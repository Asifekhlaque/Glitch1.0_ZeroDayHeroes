                <p>Your mind will naturally wander. That's completely normal. When you notice your thoughts drifting, gently acknowledge them without judgment and then guide your focus back to your breath. Think of it as training a puppyâ€”just be patient and kind to yourself.</p>

                <p>You don't need to meditate for hours. Starting with just 2-5 minutes a day is a great way to build a consistent habit. The goal is consistency, not duration. Over time, you can gradually increase the length of your sessions if you wish.</p>
